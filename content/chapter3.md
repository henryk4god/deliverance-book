# CHAPTER 3: FASTING AND PRAYER PROTOCOLS FOR BREAKTHROUGH

*"However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting." - Matthew 17:21*

## Introduction: The Power Keys to Breakthrough

You've identified the generational strongholds affecting your family (Chapter 1) and established your biblical authority to break them (Chapter 2). Now it's time to engage the most powerful breakthrough tools available to believers: strategic fasting combined with targeted prayer.

Some spiritual strongholds have been entrenched for generations and require extraordinary spiritual force to dislodge. Jesus Himself identified certain demonic powers that respond only to prayer and fasting. This chapter will equip you with proven protocols that have brought breakthroughs to thousands of families worldwide.

## Understanding Spiritual Fasting

### What is Biblical Fasting?

Biblical fasting is the voluntary abstinence from food (and sometimes other necessities) for spiritual purposes. It's not dieting, punishment, or religious ritualâ€”it's a strategic spiritual weapon that releases supernatural power for breakthrough.

### Why Fasting Works for Generational Breakthrough:

1. **Humbles the Soul:** Creates the spiritual atmosphere for God's power to move
2. **Sharpens Spiritual Sensitivity:** Reduces natural distractions and heightens spiritual awareness
3. **Demonstrates Desperation:** Shows God you're serious about breakthrough
4. **Releases Supernatural Power:** Activates divine intervention in impossible situations
5. **Breaks Demonic Resistance:** Overcomes stubborn spiritual opposition

### Biblical Examples of Breakthrough Fasting:

1. **Esther's Fast:** Saved the Jewish nation from destruction (Esther 4:16)
2. **Daniel's Fast:** Broke through 21 days of demonic resistance (Daniel 10:3-13)
3. **Nehemiah's Fast:** Opened the king's heart for Israel's restoration (Nehemiah 1:4-11)
4. **The Early Church:** Launched missionary movements through fasting and prayer (Acts 13:2-3)

## The Seven Types of Breakthrough Fasts

### 1. The Absolute Fast (Esther Fast)

- **Duration:** 3 days maximum
- **Protocol:** No food or water
- **Purpose:** Crisis intervention, desperate breakthrough needs
- **Caution:** Requires medical clearance, spiritual supervision

*"Go, gather all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day." - Esther 4:16*

**When to Use:** Life or death, spiritual crises, when facing imminent generational destruction.

### 2. The Normal Fast (Jesus Fast)

- **Duration:** 40 days
- **Protocol:** No food, water only
- **Purpose:** Major breakthrough, ministry launch, spiritual warfare
- **Preparation:** Gradual entry and exit, medical consultation for extended periods

*"And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry." - Matthew 4:2*

**When to Use:** Breaking deeply entrenched generational strongholds, establishing new spiritual authority.

### 3. The Daniel Fast (Partial Fast)

- **Duration:** 21 days (can be extended)
- **Protocol:** No meat, sweets, or delicacies. Only vegetables and water.

*"I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled." - Daniel 10:3*

**When to Use:** Initial breakthrough attempts, when normal fasting isn't possible due to health or circumstances.

### 4. The Rotation Fast

- **Duration:** Various (typically weekly patterns)
- **Protocol:** Fast certain days each week consistently
- **Purpose:** Ongoing spiritual discipline, maintaining breakthrough momentum

### 5. The Sunrise to Sunset Fast

- **Duration:** Daily from sunrise to sunset
- **Protocol:** No food or water during daylight hours
- **Purpose:** Focused prayer periods, spiritual discipline
- **Benefits:** Allows for family responsibilities, work commitments

**When to Use:** When longer fasts aren't practical but breakthrough is needed.

### 6. The Corporate Fast

- **Duration:** Varies (usually 21 days)
- **Protocol:** Entire family or church group fasts together
- **Purpose:** Family-wide breakthrough, church revival, community transformation
- **Power:** Combines individual sacrifice with spiritual agreement

**When to Use:** When the entire family needs a breakthrough, launching a generational blessing.

### 7. The Breakthrough Fast

- **Duration:** Until breakthrough manifests
- **Protocol:** Varies based on individual leading
- **Purpose:** Persistent pursuit of specific breakthrough
- **Caution:** Requires spiritual maturity and wise counsel

**When to Use:** When God specifically calls you to fast until a particular stronghold breaks.

## Strategic Prayer Protocols

### Protocol 1: The Stronghold Breaking Prayer

*"Father, in the mighty name of Jesus, I come against the stronghold of [specific issue] that has operated in my family line. I apply the blood of Jesus Christ over this area and command every demonic force to release its hold on my family. What was bound is now loosed, what was closed is now opened, what was blocked is now flowing freely. I establish [opposite blessing] as the new generational pattern for my family line. In Jesus' name, Amen."*

### Protocol 2: The Generational Cleansing Prayer

*"Lord Jesus, I repent for every sin committed by my ancestors that gave legal ground to the enemy. I confess and renounce [specific sins: occult involvement, ungodly vows, sexual immorality, violence, etc.]. I ask Your forgiveness and cleansing through Your precious blood. I break every ungodly soul tie, sever every demonic covenant, and cancel every curse spoken over my family line. I declare we are now clean, free, and blessed in Your name."*

### Protocol 3: The Blessing Establishment Prayer

*"Heavenly Father, as I have broken the negative patterns, I now establish positive generational blessings over my family. I declare that [specific blessings: financial prosperity, health, strong marriages, spiritual sensitivity, etc.] will characterize my family line from this generation forward. I speak forth life, blessing, prosperity, health, and spiritual breakthroughs over my children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. What I bind on earth is bound in heaven, what I loose on earth is loosed in heaven. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen."*

### Protocol 4: The Protection Prayer

*"Lord, I ask You to place a hedge of protection around my family as we walk in breakthrough. Let no weapon formed against us prosper. Send Your angels to guard us in all our ways. Protect us from retaliation, backlash, or any attempt by the enemy to restore broken strongholds. We are covered by the blood of Jesus and hidden in the secret place of the Most High. In Jesus' name, Amen."*
